# scad-paths

An [scad-clj](https://github.com/farrellm/scad-clj) paths library. It defines a simple, extensible, stack-based language for extruding shapes in a step-wise, relative fashion using egocentric reference frames. Reference frames are currently 2D (x,y,theta), but will be extended to support 3D paths.

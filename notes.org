#+TITLE: Notes

* Bugs

** Offset after branch
#+begin_src clojure
(defmodel bug
  (body :profile (m/circle 75/2) :name :body)
  (mask :profile (m/circle 25/2) :name :mask)
  (forward :length 3 :to [:body])
  (branch
   :from :body
   (forward :length 100 :to [:mask]))
  (offset :offset (- (- 75/2 25/2)) :to [:body])
  (forward :length 10 :to [:body])
  (hull :to [:body]))
#+end_src
 Works if you branch from :mask.
* Improvements
**  Caching

- Cache each body
- cache segment
